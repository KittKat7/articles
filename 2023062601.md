While I was working on some changes to the BigBlueButtonBN plugin in Moodle, I added some features that required info to be displayed on the room view page, if a condition was met. The template for the room view page is the `room_view.mustache` file. After I made my changes to the file, my additions would be displayed briefly before dissapearing. [See article {//TODO#kittkat 2023062602}] My initial thought was that this was some sort of caching issue, but after clearing the Moodle cache, the issue persisted. A troubleshooting step I tried was using the Moodle template viewer dev tool to look at the changed `room_view.mustache` file. Initially when using this, my changes were not visible, even after clearing the cache. Following a hunch, I went back to looking at the file, and realized that, I had not entered my changes in the spot that was used for the rendering of the examples. In the top of the file, there was a comment:
```mustache
{{!
	@template mod_bigbluebuttonbn/room_view

	This template renders the mobile page.

	Example context (json):
	{
		"bigbluebuttonbnid": 1,
		"groupid": 0,
		"statusclosed": true,
		"statusclosed": false,
		"openingtime": 123456789,
		"closingtime": 987654321
	}
}}
```
and after adding my changes to the `Example context`:
```mustache
{{!
	@template mod_bigbluebuttonbn/room_view

	This template renders the mobile page.

	Example context (json):
	{
		"bigbluebuttonbnid": 1,
		"groupid": 0,
		"statusclosed": true,
		"statusclosed": false,
		"openingtime": 123456789,
		"startingtime": 123498765,
		"closingtime": 987654321
	}
}}
```
my change was now viewable on the template viewer tool.

I have this can help anyone who has a similar issue.

Have a great day y'all.
