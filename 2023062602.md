I have been working on modifying the code for the BigBlueButtonBN plugin inside Moodle. A few of the features I was adding required information to be displayed on the room view page, which is rendered based on the `room_view.mustache` template file. For example, one of the changes I was adding was a meeting start time (different from the opening time), allowing participants to join before the meeting content started. Currently, on the room view page, the meeting opening time and closing time are displayed.
Example,
```
Opens: OpenDayTime
Closes: CloseDayTime
```
I wanted my start time to be displayed here aswell:
```
Opens: OpenDayTime
Starts: StartDayTime
Closes: CloseDayTime
```

Whether the opening and closing times are displayed, depends on whether there there values have been set.
```mustache
<div class="conf-opening-time">
	{{#openingtime}}
		<span class="conf-opening">
			<span class="font-weight-bold">{{#str}}mod_form_field_openingtime, bigbluebuttonbn{{/str}}:</span>
			{{#userdate}} {{.}}, {{#str}} strftimedaydatetime, langconfig {{/str}} {{/userdate}}
		</span>
	{{/openingtime}}
	{{#closingtime}}
		<div class="conf-closing">
			<span class="font-weight-bold">{{#str}}mod_form_field_closingtime, bigbluebuttonbn{{/str}}:</span>
			{{#userdate}} {{.}}, {{#str}} strftimedaydatetime, langconfig {{/str}} {{/userdate}}
		</div>
	{{/closingtime}}
</div>
```
I then added
```mustache
{{#startingtime}}
	<span class="conf-starting">
		<span class="font-weight-bold">{{#str}}mod_form_field_startingtime, bigbluebuttonbn{{/str}}:</span>
		{{#userdate}} {{.}}, {{#str}} strftimedaydatetime, langconfig {{/str}} {{/userdate}}
	</span>
{{/startingtime}}
```
in between `{{/openingtime}}` and `{{#closingtime}}` (from what I understand, the `#` indicates a conditional 'if given value exists' and the `/` indicates an end to the conditional block. There is also `^` which is conditional 'does not exist').

With these changes, when viewing the 'room view' page, if my starting time was set, the `Starts: StartDayTime` would be displayed briefly while the page finished loading, but would then disapear. I was also experiencing this with another item that I wanted conditionally displayed.

My troubleshooting steps mostly consisted of trying to clear the Moodle cache, over and over again. This, sadly, did not work. Initially, I did think it was a chaching issue, but after checking the template viewer in the Moodle dev tools, my changes were displayed, this led me to think that caching was not the issue. [See article {//TODO#kittkat 2023062601}]
I did some more testing, and realized that the disapearing of my additions was only happening on conditional blocks that I had added. If I added something to another conditional (one I didn't add), assuming that condition was met, my addition would be displayed correctly, without dissapearing. This led me to think that the value for my condition was not being saved.

This conclusion was correct. After digging through the files, I found the `execute_returns()` method inside the `(bigbluebuttonbn)/classes/external/meeting_info.php` file. This method creates an external value for any value that is required for a condition inside the mustache templates. After adding my values to this list,
example:
```php
// ...
'meetingid' => new external_value(PARAM_RAW, 'Meeting id'),
'openingtime' => new external_value(PARAM_INT, 'Opening time', VALUE_OPTIONAL),
'closingtime' => new external_value(PARAM_INT, 'Closing time', VALUE_OPTIONAL),
// ...
/* changed to */
// ...
'meetingid' => new external_value(PARAM_RAW, 'Meeting id'),
'openingtime' => new external_value(PARAM_INT, 'Opening time', VALUE_OPTIONAL),
// added to allow the startingtime value to be retained when displaying the room view page
'startingtime' => new external_value(PARAM_INT, 'Starting time', VALUE_OPTIONAL),
'closingtime' => new external_value(PARAM_INT, 'Closing time', VALUE_OPTIONAL),
// ...
```
my added conditional blocks stopped dissapearing, and as long as the condition was met, remained on the page.

I have this can help anyone who has a similar issue.

Have a great day y'all.
